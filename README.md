--Introduction - the project's aim--
To be able to have a working daily calendar that demonstrates current time.  You are also able to add and save to the calendar.

--Built With-- HTML 5 CSS Javascript Bootstrap

Screen shots:

First I worked on the time and date to be current.

Then I added the calendar, but it was not following any current time and date, had to return to code and figure out how to fix the time and date.

I was able to redefine when to update the time and date, and got the calendar and time and date synched and working.
